<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Apple iOS currently controls a little over 43% of the US smartphone market, providing access to more than 79 million iPhone users in the US. The ResearchKit platform immediately garnered a great deal of interest within the biomedical research community.   </p>
<p>As exciting as this new framework is Apple provided no guidance on how the data collected was to be stored and managed.  This is where the Biomedical Data as a Service Internal Research and Development (IR&amp;D) project comes in.  Designed and implmented by the Research Computing Division, this solution includes the following basic components: an iOS code library, a cloud-based data host, a service layer implementing data exchange application programming interfaces, and a dashboard UI for management.  Instrument developers simply include the iOS library in their IOS application code to connect to the data service via the REST based web API.  Study managers manage their datasets and perform exploratory analytics via the dashboard UI. The system design and implementation incorporates US legal and regulatory compliance with respect to data privacy and security. </p>
<p>Apple launched its ResearchKit framework for iOS on March 9, 2015. ResearchKit is an open source software framework designed to aid in the creation of mobile apps for biomedical and health research. ResearchKit simplifies construction of highly functional apps. Support is provided for various app modules, including informed consent, passive data collection, active tasks, surveys and data dashboards. Apple iOS currently controls a little over 43% of the US smartphone market, providing access to more than 79 million iPhone users in the US. The ResearchKit platform immediately garnered a great deal of interest within the biomedical research community.</p>
<p>Five apps developed with ResearchKit were also released at the debut press event. In March Stanford University researchers found that 11,000 people had signed up for a cardiovascular study using Apple Inc.’s ResearchKit, less than 24 hours after the iPhone tool was introduced. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research collaborated with nonprofit group Sage Bionetworks to develop The Parkinson’s app, which had 5,589 consenting users with 24 hours of launch. These early results suggest a healthy future for biomedical research using data gathered from mobile apps, and for the ResearchKit framework. RCD has already developed a very simple ResearchKit app, but currently has no backend data service to securely receive and manage the data collected. Exhibit 1 is a screenshot of this example app. With our rich capabilities in health research, research data management, statistical analysis, and data sciences, we need to explore the potential of ResearchKit for our business. </p>
<p>Deployed ResearchKit apps generate a great deal of data, presenting operational challenges for researchers.  Given the nature of the data, privacy and security concerns must be addressed with care. The ResearchKit framework provides no specific capabilities for dealing with these data, relying on built-in iOS functions. Apple offers no recommendations or backend service for storing, securing, managing and analyzing the data collected using ResearchKit apps. Researchers seeking to leverage this technology may not be able to easily develop deployable solutions without resolving significant technical challenges. </p>
<p>These challenges represent an opportunity for RTI to step forward with solutions. We propose that RTI build the tools and framework necessary to provide biomedical data management for ResearchKit apps as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a capability offered to clients in the context of RTI-led biomedical research projects; and</li>
<li>As an RTI-managed service offered to clients conducting their own biomedical research.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution would include the following basic components: an iOS code library, a cloud-based data host, a service layer implementing data exchange APIs, and a dashboard UI for management.  Exhibit 2 is a simplified diagram showing the flow of data between ReseachKit applications, the proposed backend data service, and researchers. Implementers would include the iOS library in their app code, and connect to our data host via the service APIs.  Users would manage their datasets and perform exploratory analytics via the dashboard UI. The system design and implementation would incorporate US legal and regulatory compliance with respect to data privacy and security. </p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="../images/researchkit.png" /></p>
<p>This project would build and demonstrate the feasibility of a service designed to gather and help analyze biomedical data from users of mobile apps developed using ResearchKit. This new capability would be a logical extension and modernization of our existing biomedical data collection, management, and research business. RTI currently cannot offer this capability to clients. 
This new service will leverage the experience skills of our staff in research data center technologies and operations (e.g. research protocol design and oversight, human subjects research, data privacy and security, data collection and management, statistical analysis, data visualization), and should help generate business in those areas. In developing this service the project team will consult the RTI Center for Advanced Health Information Technology (CAHIT), Information Technology Services (ITS), the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the Center for Data Sciences (CDS). This service, while developed to receive data from ResearchKit applications running on iOS mobile devices, could also serve as a backend for other mobile applications for biomedical research, such as RTI’s PHIT application.
Examples of RTI projects that could use the new capabilities developed by this IR&amp;D project immediately include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emerging Technology Trends, a FY2016 IR&amp;D project that will build a native iOS app for passive data collection using iBeacon or other sensor standards. </li>
<li>Disrupting the cycle of addiction: bringing biomarkers of behavior into better treatment, An RTI Grand Challenge Proposal current being reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apple Inc.’s ResearchKit is a new platform for advanced medical research using Apple’s leading edge mobile devices. This platform provides access to more than 40% of smartphone users in the US. Apple’s market share in other developed countries is similar. We should take advantage of this opportunity and add this capability to our existing set of research tools.</p></div>
