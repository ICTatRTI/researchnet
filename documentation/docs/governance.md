In recognition of the importance of keeping Protected Health Information (PHI) secure, RTI has implemented all applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), including the Omnibus Rule enacted in 2013. As a Hybrid Entity, RTI places great importance on the effective operation of HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach Notification and Enforcement Rules including the privacy and security provisions of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) to protect PHI.
RTI has designated both HIPAA Security and Privacy Officers to review and ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations. These experienced professionals are experts in their field in implementing and monitoring robust policies, procedures, and IT environments that ensure the protection of PHI.
 
In addition, RTI’s HIPAA environment meets all administrative, physical, and technical security standards, as well as policy, procedure, and documentation safeguard standards, including minimum necessary access requirements, active log monitoring, and robust training.  To protect our reputation as an industry leader, RTI places great importance on maintaining the highest standards of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for our clients’ data subject to the HIPAA standards.
 
RTI’s FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) risk compliant infrastructure represents a notable strength for RTI in managing client projects. RTI’s network meets all National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) confidentiality, integrity, and availability security standards for the FIPS low or moderate risk, allowing RTI to provide the appropriate level of security for the information, including personally identifiable information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI).
