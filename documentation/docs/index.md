ResearchNet is a flexible, cloud-enabled back-end for Computer Assisted Self Interview (CASI) systems. 

For the survey researcher, this platform provides a secure mechanism for managing enrollment, processing consent, and collecting the survey data. 


Under the hood, ResearchNet is comprised of three software components:  a set of REST APIs for developers, a software development kit (SDK) supporting IOS, and a simple dashboard for monitoring the study progress.
