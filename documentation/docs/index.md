ResearchNet is an online platform designed to empower medical researchers to use Apple's ResearchKit to enroll participants and conduct studies. 

For the medical researcher, this platform provides a secure mechanism for managing enrollment, processing consent, and collecting the survey data. 


Under the hood, ResearchNet is comprised of three software components:  a set of REST APIs for developers, a software development kit (SDK) for IOS,  and a simple dashboard for monitoring the study progress.
